# Button-Click-Count
Counts the number of clicks

In Java GUI, the JButton is a crucial element for user interaction. You create a button using new JButton("Button Text"), 
and it appears on your window. To make a button do something, you implement the ActionListener interface, specifically its 
actionPerformed method. This method is automatically triggered whenever the button is clicked.
You can also set a default button which will activate when the Enter key is pressed.
